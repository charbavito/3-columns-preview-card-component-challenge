## <strong>The Challenge</strong>
One more challenge solved with HTML and CSS only. Despite the layout being very simple, this challenge was very interesting to incorporate a new concept that I learned, which is building layouts using CSS Grid.

## <strong>Technology Used</strong>

## <strong>My Process</strong>
As usual I started by configuring the project folder and initializing the version control system and gitignore file. Then I structured all the content sematically in HTML and proceeded to configuring style to desktop version using SASS pre-processor. After finishing the desktop version, I beging the mobile version using media queries. Finally, I finished with the Readme file and the adaptations of the HTML and CSS files according to the validation of the W3C Markup Validation Service website

### <strong>What I learned</strong>
Despite the layout of this challenge being very simple, I chose to do it in a different way, trying a new concept that I have learned which is <strong>CSS Grid</strong> as an alternative to Flexbox. I believe that I executed it very efficiently and I really liked the final result, both in the desktop and mobile versions, which also reinforces my bases of responsiveness in layouts with media queries.
